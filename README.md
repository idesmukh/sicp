# Computer science from first principes with Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

This repository showcases my journey exploring the book **Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)** by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman. I chose to study SICP because it teaches one to think from first principles about abstraction, which is what all of computer science is about. My vision is to engineer infrastructure for large-scale systems and SICP will provide me with the best mental models on this journey.

> The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, are chiefly these three: 1. Combining several simple ideas into one compound one, and thus all complex ideas are made. 2. The second is bringing two ideas, whether simple or complex, together, and setting them by one another, so as to take a view of them at once, without uniting them into one, by which it gets all its ideas of relations. 3. The third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real existence: this is called abstraction,
and thus all its general ideas are made.

## What's inside

The repository has been structured in the form of folders for each chapter. Each chapter folder contains a `README.md` with my notes and observations, along with an `exercises` folder that contains all the solutions to the exercises.

-----

## Getting started

To run the code examples and work through the exercises, you will need a **Scheme interpreter**. You will need to download and install Racket, install the SICP language package, and select the SICP language in the DrRacket editor.
